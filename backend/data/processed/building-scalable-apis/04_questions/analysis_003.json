Use distributed tracing to understand the flow of requests through your system. This becomes especially important as your architecture becomes more complex with multiple services. Set up proper alerting so you can respond quickly to issues before they impact your users significantly. ## Conclusion Building scalable APIs requires careful planning and consideration of multiple factors. By following these principles and continuously monitoring your system's performance, you can build APIs that grow with your business needs. Remember that scalability is not just about handling more requests - it's also about maintaining reliability, performance, and developer experience as your system grows.",
