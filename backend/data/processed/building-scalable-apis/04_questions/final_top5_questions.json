    {
      "rank": 1,
      "question": "What concise framework (latency, consistency, cost, complexity) would you use to decide between caching, queues, and read replicas, and what practical metrics matter?",
      "leverage_reason": "Highest practical impact; provides an actionable, repeatable decision framework the audience can apply immediately and invites follow-up on concrete metrics across latency, consistency, cost, and complexity."
    },
    {
      "rank": 2,
      "question": "For operations needing strict ordering or transactions, how do you replace or augment asynchronous queues without sacrificing correctness?",
      "leverage_reason": "Elicits deep thinking about correctness vs throughput and opens paths to concrete patterns like sagas, compensating actions, or idempotent designs that apply across systems."
    },
    {
      "rank": 3,
      "question": "Is there a domain where synchronous, server-side stateful design outperforms stateless APIs for UX, and what are the concrete patterns?",
      "leverage_reason": "Contrarian hook that challenges stateless dogma, prompts domain-specific justification, and broad architectural re-evaluation across UX-centric domains."
    },
    {
      "rank": 4,
      "question": "If data freshness is non-negotiable, can caching strategies ever be safe and coherent across clients, and what tradeoffs must be acknowledged?",
      "leverage_reason": "Targets a core design tension, driving exploration of invalidation strategies, coherence guarantees, and safety risks with real-world implications."
    },
    {
      "rank": 5,
      "question": "How can observability signals be tied to business outcomes, and what experiments would validate the link beyond uptime?",
      "leverage_reason": "Bridges technical metrics to business value, enabling cross-functional relevance and actionable experimentation for product, engineering, and leadership audiences."
