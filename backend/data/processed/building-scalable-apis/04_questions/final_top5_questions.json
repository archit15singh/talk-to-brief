    {
      "rank": 1,
      "question": "How would you design a hybrid model that preserves statelessness but still guarantees strong consistency for critical data?",
      "leverage_reason": "High asymmetry: challenges the default stateless approach by forcing a deep dive into patterns like CQRS/Sagas and hybrid read/write designs; connects data consistency, latency, and governance across architectures."
    },
    {
      "rank": 2,
      "question": "When does TTL-based caching become a correctness risk, and what signals would you monitor to detect it?",
      "leverage_reason": "Targets a concrete, actionable correctness risk with observable signals; yields guardrails, monitoring strategies, and testable assumptions."
    },
    {
      "rank": 3,
      "question": "Could external dependencies be the true bottlenecks, making internal observability less effective?",
      "leverage_reason": "Shifts focus from internal systems to vendor reliability and integration risk; creates asymmetry by challenging assumptions about controllability and connected SLAs."
    },
    {
      "rank": 4,
      "question": "If tracing is noisy and causes alert fatigue, what practical heuristics separate signal from noise in production?",
      "leverage_reason": "Transforms observability into actionable, repeatable practices; directly improves MTTR and decision quality, with cross-cutting impact on tooling and process."
    },
    {
      "rank": 5,
      "question": "With AI-assisted observability auto-triage, will teams over-rely on automation and overlook fundamental design issues or data security?",
      "leverage_reason": "Probes governance and potential failure modes of automation; connects design quality, security, and operational practices in a future-facing context."
