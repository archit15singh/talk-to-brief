      "question": "What if user-specific state must persist across requests (e.g., carts, login context)—does statelessness still deliver net value?",
      "leverage_reason": "Cuts through boilerplate and forces consideration of core trade-offs between simplicity and latency, with broad implications for personalization, session handling, and authorization context."

      "rank": 2,
      "question": "How would cache invalidation and data freshness failures undermine trust—where's the boundary between speed and correctness?",
      "leverage_reason": "Highlights practical risks of caching and invites discussion on correctness guarantees and real-world thresholds for stale data."
    },
    {
      "rank": 3,
      "question": "Can high write throughput or strong consistency requirements break the read-replica model—when does replication lag become unacceptable?",
      "leverage_reason": "Explores architectural limits and prompts follow-up on alternatives (multi-region writes, CQRS, stronger consistency modes)."
    },
    {
      "rank": 4,
      "question": "If edge computing makes stateless at the edge the default, how would pricing and vendor strategy shift in a multi-cloud world?",
      "leverage_reason": "Future economic and strategic implications affecting vendor lock-in, cost models, and data distribution decisions."

      "rank": 5,
      "question": "What metrics and governance controls prove that stateless, caching, and asynchronous designs deliver value and safety in production?",
      "leverage_reason": "Translates theory into measurable governance; anchors discussions on dashboards, thresholds, and accountability across teams."
