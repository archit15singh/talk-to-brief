  "original_text": "# Building Scalable APIs - Transcript ## Introduction Welcome to today's discussion on building scalable APIs. In this session, we'll explore the fundamental principles and best practices for creating APIs that can handle growth and maintain performance under load. ## Core Principles When building scalable APIs, there are several key principles to keep in mind. First, design for statelessness. Stateless APIs are much easier to scale horizontally because any server can handle any request without needing to maintain session information. Second, implement proper caching strategies. Caching can dramatically reduce the load on your backend systems and improve response times for your users. \n\nConsider both client-side caching and server-side caching mechanisms. Third, use asynchronous processing where appropriate. Not every operation needs to be synchronous. For heavy computations or operations that don't require immediate feedback, consider using message queues and background processing. ## Database Considerations Database design plays a crucial role in API scalability. Consider using read replicas to distribute read operations across multiple database instances. \n\nThis can significantly improve performance for read-heavy workloads. ",
