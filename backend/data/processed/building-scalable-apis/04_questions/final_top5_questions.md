# Top 5 High-Leverage Questions

*Generated: 2025-09-19T02:43:30.374563*

## 1. What if user-specific state must persist across requests (e.g., carts, login context)—does statelessness still deliver net value?

**Why this creates leverage:** Cuts through boilerplate and forces consideration of core trade-offs between simplicity and latency, with broad implications for personalization, session handling, and authorization context.

## 2. How would cache invalidation and data freshness failures undermine trust—where's the boundary between speed and correctness?

**Why this creates leverage:** Highlights practical risks of caching and invites discussion on correctness guarantees and real-world thresholds for stale data.

## 3. Can high write throughput or strong consistency requirements break the read-replica model—when does replication lag become unacceptable?

**Why this creates leverage:** Explores architectural limits and prompts follow-up on alternatives (multi-region writes, CQRS, stronger consistency modes).

## 4. If edge computing makes stateless at the edge the default, how would pricing and vendor strategy shift in a multi-cloud world?

**Why this creates leverage:** Future economic and strategic implications affecting vendor lock-in, cost models, and data distribution decisions.

## 5. What metrics and governance controls prove that stateless, caching, and asynchronous designs deliver value and safety in production?

**Why this creates leverage:** Translates theory into measurable governance; anchors discussions on dashboards, thresholds, and accountability across teams.
