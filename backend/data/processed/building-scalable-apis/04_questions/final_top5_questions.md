# Top 5 High-Leverage Questions

*Generated: 2025-09-19T02:57:07.168343*

## 1. What concise framework (latency, consistency, cost, complexity) would you use to decide between caching, queues, and read replicas, and what practical metrics matter?

**Why this creates leverage:** Highest practical impact; provides an actionable, repeatable decision framework the audience can apply immediately and invites follow-up on concrete metrics across latency, consistency, cost, and complexity.

## 2. For operations needing strict ordering or transactions, how do you replace or augment asynchronous queues without sacrificing correctness?

**Why this creates leverage:** Elicits deep thinking about correctness vs throughput and opens paths to concrete patterns like sagas, compensating actions, or idempotent designs that apply across systems.

## 3. Is there a domain where synchronous, server-side stateful design outperforms stateless APIs for UX, and what are the concrete patterns?

**Why this creates leverage:** Contrarian hook that challenges stateless dogma, prompts domain-specific justification, and broad architectural re-evaluation across UX-centric domains.

## 4. If data freshness is non-negotiable, can caching strategies ever be safe and coherent across clients, and what tradeoffs must be acknowledged?

**Why this creates leverage:** Targets a core design tension, driving exploration of invalidation strategies, coherence guarantees, and safety risks with real-world implications.

## 5. How can observability signals be tied to business outcomes, and what experiments would validate the link beyond uptime?

**Why this creates leverage:** Bridges technical metrics to business value, enabling cross-functional relevance and actionable experimentation for product, engineering, and leadership audiences.
