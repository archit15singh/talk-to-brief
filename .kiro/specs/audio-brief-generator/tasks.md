# Tasks

- [x] 1. Project setup: structure + requirements.txt + prompts

- [x] 2. Build transcribe.py: faster-whisper (base model) → word-level timestamped transcript.txt

- [x] 3. Build analyze_chunk.py: intelligent chunking (~1200 words) → parallel GPT-4 → partials/*.json

- [x] 4. Build merge_brief.py: merge partials → final brief.md

- [x] 5. Add OPENAI_API_KEY validation + multi-format audio support + error handling

- [x] 6. Build pipeline.py: complete orchestrator with step-by-step execution and validation

- [x] 7. Add validate_setup.py: comprehensive prerequisite validation

- [x] 8. Implement intelligent merging with GPT-4 and rule-based fallback

- [x] 9. Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout pipeline

- [x] 10. Test with sample audio files and generate working outputs

## ✅ **PROJECT COMPLETE**

The Audio Brief Generator is fully implemented and working. All core functionality has been built and tested:

### **Implemented Features:**
- **Audio Transcription**: faster-whisper with word-level timestamps and comprehensive validation
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Smart segmentation respecting sentence boundaries (~1200 words)
- **Parallel Analysis**: Concurrent GPT-4 processing with rate limiting (4 workers)
- **Smart Merging**: GPT-4 intelligent merging with rule-based fallback
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Complete workflow with step-by-step execution
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and graceful error recovery
- **Multi-format Support**: WAV, MP3, M4A, MP4, FLAC, OGG, WebM, AAC
- **Configuration**: Customizable prompts and parameters

### **Generated Outputs:**
- Timestamped transcripts with word-level detail
- Structured JSON partials with analysis results
- Final markdown briefs with executive summary, approach scripts, strategic questions, timeline highlights, and key insights

### **Usage:**
```bash
# Complete pipeline
python pipeline.py data/audio/your_file.mp3

# Individual steps
python pipeline.py data/audio/your_file.mp3 --step transcribe
python pipeline.py data/audio/your_file.mp3 --step analyze  
python pipeline.py data/audio/your_file.mp3 --step merge

# Validation
python validate_setup.py
```

The project is production-ready and has been successfully tested with sample audio files.
