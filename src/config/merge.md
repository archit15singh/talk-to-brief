# Merge Prompt for Final Output

You have multiple partial outputs from different segments of the same talk. Merge them into ONE final output with the same four sections:

## 1) Approach Script (3 sentences)
## 2) Five High-Signal Questions (≤ 2 lines each, each tied to a timestamp)
## 3) Timeline Highlights (8–12 bullets, chronological, no duplicates)
## 4) Key Claims, Assumptions, Trade-offs (deduplicated, concise lists)

## Instructions:
- Deduplicate overlapping items.
- Preserve timestamps; if duplicates have same timestamp, merge wording.
- Keep total output under 800 words.
- Ensure sections flow naturally as if it came from one continuous talk.
- Return clean markdown-formatted text.
