Bigger server, more RAM, faster disks. That bought us maybe 3 months. The real solution? Read replicas, connection pooling, and query optimization. But here's the thing - you need to design for this from the beginning. **Audience Member:** What about caching? **Alex:** Great question! Caching is absolutely critical, but it's not a silver bullet. We implemented Redis caching at multiple layers - application level, database query level, and even HTTP response caching. But here's what nobody tells you about caching - cache invalidation is the hardest part. We spent more time debugging cache inconsistencies than we saved from the performance gains initially. ## Microservices: The Good, Bad, and Ugly **Alex:** Eventually, we broke our monolith into microservices. This solved some problems and created others. Independent scaling, technology diversity, team autonomy.
