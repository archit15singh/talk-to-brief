[Previous context: ...ough your entire system. ## Security at Scale **Alex:** Security becomes more complex as you scale.]

What worked for 100 users doesn't work for 100,000. JWT tokens, proper CORS configuration, input validation, SQL injection prevention - these are table stakes. But at scale, you also need to think about DDoS protection, API key management, and audit logging. We learned this lesson when we got hit with a credential stuffing attack. Our authentication endpoint became a bottleneck overnight. ## Monitoring and Observability **Alex:** You cannot run a scalable API without proper monitoring. I'm talking about three pillars: metrics, logs, and traces. Metrics tell you what's happening. 

Logs tell you why it's happening. Traces tell you where it's happening in your distributed system. We use Prometheus for metrics, structured logging with ELK stack, and distributed tracing with Jaeger. The investment in tooling pays for itself the first time you need to debug a production issue at 2 AM. ## Performance Optimization **Alex:** Let's talk about performance. There are low-hanging fruits and then there are architectural changes. 

Enable gzip compression, use CDNs for static content, optimize your database queries, implement proper indexing. Async processing for heavy operations, event-driven architecture, and sometimes, choosing the right database for the job. We moved our analytics workload from PostgreSQL to ClickHouse and saw a 10x performance improvement. ## The Human Factor **Alex:** Here's something that doesn't get talked about enough - the human factor in scaling APIs. As your system grows, your team grows. 

You need proper documentation, code review processes, and deployment pipelines. 

You need to think about on-call rotations and incident response procedures. The best technical architecture in the world won't save you if your team can't maintain it. ## Key Takeaways **Alex:** Let me wrap up with five key takeaways: 1. Design for observability from day one 2. Separate concerns early, even in a monolith 3.
