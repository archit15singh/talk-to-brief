The speaker advises against adopting microservices prematurely, emphasizing the importance of investing in observability and service mesh technologies when the time comes. Key challenges in API growth include implementing rate limiting and circuit breakers to manage system overload and downstream failures, as well as enhancing security measures to handle increased user volume. Effective monitoring through metrics, logs, and traces is crucial for maintaining a scalable API, with specific tools like Prometheus, ELK stack, and Jaeger recommended for optimal performance and debugging.
