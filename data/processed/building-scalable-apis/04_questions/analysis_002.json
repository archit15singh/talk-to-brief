We've all been there. ## The Journey Begins **Alex:** Let me start with a story. Three years ago, I joined a startup with a simple REST API. It handled about 100 requests per minute. The entire codebase was one Express.js file. 500 lines. Everything worked perfectly. Fast forward 18 months - we're processing 50,000 requests per minute, the database is crying, and our single server is basically on fire. Sound familiar? *[Audience chuckles]* ## Lesson 1: Design for Growth, Not Just Today **Alex:** The first lesson I learned the hard way is this: you don't have to over-engineer from day one, but you need to design with growth in mind. What does this mean practically? First, separate your concerns early. Even if you start with a monolith, structure it like microservices internally. ",
