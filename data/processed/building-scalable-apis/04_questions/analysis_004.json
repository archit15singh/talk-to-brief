You can't optimize what you can't measure. ## The Database Bottleneck **Alex:** Let's talk about databases. This is where most APIs hit their first major wall. *[Clicks to next slide]* We started with a single PostgreSQL instance. Worked great until it didn't. Our first instinct was to throw more hardware at it. Bigger server, more RAM, faster disks. That bought us maybe 3 months. The real solution? Read replicas, connection pooling, and query optimization. But here's the thing - you need to design for this from the beginning. **Audience Member:** What about caching? **Alex:** Great question! Caching is absolutely critical, but it's not a silver bullet. We implemented Redis caching at multiple layers - application level, database query level, and even HTTP response caching. But here's what nobody tells you about caching - cache invalidation is the hardest part. We spent more time debugging cache inconsistencies than we saved from the performance gains initially. ## Microservices: The Good, Bad, and Ugly **Alex:** Eventually, we broke our monolith into microservices. This solved some problems and created others. Independent scaling, technology diversity, team autonomy. Network latency, distributed debugging, data consistency challenges. ",
