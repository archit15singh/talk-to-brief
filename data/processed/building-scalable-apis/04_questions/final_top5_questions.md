# Top 5 High-Leverage Questions

## 1. How would you design a hybrid model that preserves statelessness but still guarantees strong consistency for critical data?

**Why this creates leverage:** High asymmetry: challenges the default stateless approach by forcing a deep dive into patterns like CQRS/Sagas and hybrid read/write designs; connects data consistency, latency, and governance across architectures.

## 2. When does TTL-based caching become a correctness risk, and what signals would you monitor to detect it?

**Why this creates leverage:** Targets a concrete, actionable correctness risk with observable signals; yields guardrails, monitoring strategies, and testable assumptions.

## 3. Could external dependencies be the true bottlenecks, making internal observability less effective?

**Why this creates leverage:** Shifts focus from internal systems to vendor reliability and integration risk; creates asymmetry by challenging assumptions about controllability and connected SLAs.

## 4. If tracing is noisy and causes alert fatigue, what practical heuristics separate signal from noise in production?

**Why this creates leverage:** Transforms observability into actionable, repeatable practices; directly improves MTTR and decision quality, with cross-cutting impact on tooling and process.

## 5. With AI-assisted observability auto-triage, will teams over-rely on automation and overlook fundamental design issues or data security?

**Why this creates leverage:** Probes governance and potential failure modes of automation; connects design quality, security, and operational practices in a future-facing context.
