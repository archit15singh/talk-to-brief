  "original_text": "*[Audience laughs]* My advice? Don't go microservices until you have to. But when you do, invest heavily in observability and service mesh technologies. ## Rate Limiting and Circuit Breakers **Alex:** As your API grows, you'll face two critical challenges: protecting your system from overload and handling downstream failures gracefully. Rate limiting isn't just about preventing abuse - it's about ensuring fair resource allocation. We implemented a token bucket algorithm with different tiers for different user types. Circuit breakers saved our bacon more times than I can count. When a downstream service starts failing, you need to fail fast rather than cascade the failure through your entire system. ## Security at Scale **Alex:** Security becomes more complex as you scale. What worked for 100 users doesn't work for 100,000. JWT tokens, proper CORS configuration, input validation, SQL injection prevention - these are table stakes. But at scale, you also need to think about DDoS protection, API key management, and audit logging. We learned this lesson when we got hit with a credential stuffing attack. Our authentication endpoint became a bottleneck overnight. ## Monitoring and Observability **Alex:** You cannot run a scalable API without proper monitoring. I'm talking about three pillars: metrics, logs, and traces. Metrics tell you what's happening. Logs tell you why it's happening. Traces tell you where it's happening in your distributed system. We use Prometheus for metrics, structured logging with ELK stack, and distributed tracing with Jaeger. The investment in tooling pays for itself the first time you need to debug a production issue at 2 AM. ## Performance Optimization **Alex:** Let's talk about performance. There are low-hanging fruits and then there are architectural changes. ",
