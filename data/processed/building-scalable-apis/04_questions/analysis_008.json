  "original_text": "You need to think about on-call rotations and incident response procedures. The best technical architecture in the world won't save you if your team can't maintain it. ## Key Takeaways **Alex:** Let me wrap up with five key takeaways: 1. Design for observability from day one 2. Separate concerns early, even in a monolith 3. Cache strategically, but prepare for cache invalidation complexity 4. Don't go microservices until you have to, but when you do, invest in tooling 5. Security and performance are not afterthoughts - they're architectural decisions ## Q&A Session **Audience Member 1:** What's your take on GraphQL vs REST for scalable APIs? **Alex:** Great question. We actually use both. REST for simple CRUD operations and public APIs, GraphQL for complex data fetching where clients need flexibility. GraphQL can be more efficient for mobile clients, but it adds complexity in caching and security. Choose based on your use case, not hype. **Audience Member 2:** How do you handle API versioning at scale? **Alex:** We use semantic versioning with backward compatibility as much as possible. When we need breaking changes, we run multiple versions in parallel with a deprecation timeline. Header-based versioning works better than URL-based for us. And always, always communicate changes well in advance to your API consumers. **Audience Member 3:** What about testing strategies for large APIs? **Alex:** Testing becomes critical at scale. We have unit tests, integration tests, contract tests between services, and end-to-end tests. But here's the key - we also do chaos engineering. Randomly killing services in production teaches you a lot about your system's resilience. *[More questions continue...]* ## Closing **Alex:** Building scalable APIs is a journey, not a destination. Every system is different, every team is different. What worked for us might not work for you, but I hope these lessons help you avoid some of the pitfalls we encountered. ",
