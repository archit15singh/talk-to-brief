[Previous context: ...solved some problems and created others. Independent scaling, technology diversity, team autonomy.]

Network latency, distributed debugging, data consistency challenges. Service discovery, monitoring complexity, and the dreaded distributed transactions. *[Audience laughs]* My advice? Don't go microservices until you have to. But when you do, invest heavily in observability and service mesh technologies. ## Rate Limiting and Circuit Breakers **Alex:** As your API grows, you'll face two critical challenges: protecting your system from overload and handling downstream failures gracefully. Rate limiting isn't just about preventing abuse - it's about ensuring fair resource allocation. We implemented a token bucket algorithm with different tiers for different user types. Circuit breakers saved our bacon more times than I can count. When a downstream service starts failing, you need to fail fast rather than cascade the failure through your entire system. ## Security at Scale **Alex:** Security becomes more complex as you scale.
