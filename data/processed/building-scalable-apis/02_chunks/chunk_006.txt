[Previous context: ...advance to your API consumers. **Audience Member 3:** What about testing strategies for large APIs?]

**Alex:** Testing becomes critical at scale. We have unit tests, integration tests, contract tests between services, and end-to-end tests. But here's the key - we also do chaos engineering. Randomly killing services in production teaches you a lot about your system's resilience. *[More questions continue...]* ## Closing **Alex:** Building scalable APIs is a journey, not a destination. Every system is different, every team is different. What worked for us might not work for you, but I hope these lessons help you avoid some of the pitfalls we encountered. 

Remember - premature optimization is the root of all evil, but so is ignoring scalability until it's too late. Find the balance that works for your context. Thank you all for your attention, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions!
