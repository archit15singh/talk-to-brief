# Final Output

## 1) Approach Script
Welcome to the discussion on practical tactics for building reliable AI applications. I bring to the table 15 years of experience as a startup co-founder and CEO, with the last few years dedicated to developing GNI projects. Let's delve into why the standard software development lifecycle often falls short when applied to AI, and how we can tackle this challenge. We will also explore the importance of understanding the reasons behind the failure of a test, highlighting that it could be due to a poorly defined test or a malfunctioning solution. 

## 2) Five High-Signal Questions
- At [00:22], why do you think nobody does it this way yet?
- At [01:57], how does the non-deterministic nature of AI models affect the reliability of AI applications?
- At [03:44], why are factuality and other data science metrics not sufficient for evaluating AI solutions?
- At [09:15], how do you suggest modifying the logic or data used in a test when a solution isn't working as expected?
- At [13:39], how can we ensure that evaluations are done frequently and effectively?

## 4) Key Claims, Assumptions, Trade-offs
- **Claims**:
  - AI applications face unique challenges that the standard software development lifecycle doesn't address.
  - Data science metrics are not sufficient for evaluating AI solutions.
  - Real-world scenarios and specific metrics are crucial for building reliable AI applications.
  - Evaluations should focus on details, not just average numbers.
  - Test failures can be due to poorly defined tests or malfunctioning solutions.
  - Continuous improvement of evaluations is crucial for success.
- **Assumptions**:
  - AI models are non-deterministic, making them harder to manage and predict.
  - The speaker assumes that the audience understands the standard software development lifecycle.
  - Different models will require different evaluations.
  - Frequent evaluations lead to rapid progress with fewer regressions.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Spending more time on building evaluations at the beginning of the process can lead to more reliable AI applications.
  - Using specific metrics instead of generic ones can lead to better understanding of AI performance, but may require more time and resources.
  - Focusing on real-world scenarios and user expectations may limit the scope of AI applications, but increases their reliability and usefulness.
  - Spending time on detailed evaluations can lead to better understanding and improvement of systems.
  - Experimentation may lead to failures, but these failures can provide valuable insights.
  - Using a specific platform for evaluations may limit flexibility, but it can streamline the evaluation process.
