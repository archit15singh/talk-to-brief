## Introduction

**Alex Chen:** Good morning everyone! Thanks for joining me today. I'm Alex, and I've been building APIs for the past eight years. Today I want to share some hard-learned lessons about scaling APIs from zero to millions of requests per day.

*[Audience applause]*

So, who here has built an API that started simple and then... well, let's just say it got complicated? 

*[Several hands raise]*

Yeah, I thought so. We've all been there.

## The Journey Begins

**Alex:** Let me start with a story. Three years ago, I joined a startup with a simple REST API. It handled about 100 requests per minute. The entire codebase was one Express.js file. 500 lines. Everything worked perfectly.

Fast forward 18 months - we're processing 50,000 requests per minute, the database is crying, and our single server is basically on fire. Sound familiar?

*[Audience chuckles]*

## Lesson 1: Design for Growth, Not Just Today

**Alex:** The first lesson I learned the hard way is this: you don't have to over-engineer from day one, but you need to design with growth in mind.

What does this mean practically?

First, separate your concerns early. Even if you start with a monolith, structure it like microservices internally. Use proper layering - controllers, services, data access. This makes it easier to extract services later.

Second, think about your data models. That user table with 10 columns? It's going to have 50 columns in two years. Plan for it.

Third, and this is crucial - instrument everything from day one. You can't optimize what you can't measure.

## The Database Bottleneck

**Alex:** Let's talk about databases. This is where most APIs hit their first major wall.

*[Clicks to next slide]*

We started with a single PostgreSQL instance. Worked great until it didn't. Our first instinct was to throw more hardware at it. Bigger server, more RAM, faster disks. That bought us maybe 3 months.

The real solution? Read replicas, connection pooling, and query optimization. But here's the thing - you need to design for this from the beginning.

**Audience Member:** What about caching?

**Alex:** Great question! Caching is absolutely critical, but it's not a silver bullet. We implemented Redis caching at multiple layers - application level, database query level, and even HTTP response caching.

But here's what nobody tells you about caching - cache invalidation is the hardest part. We spent more time debugging cache inconsistencies than we saved from the performance gains initially.

## Microservices: The Good, Bad, and Ugly

**Alex:** Eventually, we broke our monolith into microservices. This solved some problems and created others.

The good: Independent scaling, technology diversity, team autonomy.

The bad: Network latency, distributed debugging, data consistency challenges.

The ugly: Service discovery, monitoring complexity, and the dreaded distributed transactions.

*[Audience laughs]*

My advice? Don't go microservices until you have to. But when you do, invest heavily in observability and service mesh technologies.

## Rate Limiting and Circuit Breakers

**Alex:** As your API grows, you'll face two critical challenges: protecting your system from overload and handling downstream failures gracefully.

Rate limiting isn't just about preventing abuse - it's about ensuring fair resource allocation. We implemented a token bucket algorithm with different tiers for different user types.

Circuit breakers saved our bacon more times than I can count. When a downstream service starts failing, you need to fail fast rather than cascade the failure through your entire system.

## Security at Scale

**Alex:** Security becomes more complex as you scale. What worked for 100 users doesn't work for 100,000.

JWT tokens, proper CORS configuration, input validation, SQL injection prevention - these are table stakes. But at scale, you also need to think about DDoS protection, API key management, and audit logging.

We learned this lesson when we got hit with a credential stuffing attack. Our authentication endpoint became a bottleneck overnight.

## Monitoring and Observability

**Alex:** You cannot run a scalable API without proper monitoring. I'm talking about three pillars: metrics, logs, and traces.

Metrics tell you what's happening. Logs tell you why it's happening. Traces tell you where it's happening in your distributed system.

We use Prometheus for metrics, structured logging with ELK stack, and distributed tracing with Jaeger. The investment in tooling pays for itself the first time you need to debug a production issue at 2 AM.

## Performance Optimization

**Alex:** Let's talk about performance. There are low-hanging fruits and then there are architectural changes.

Low-hanging fruits: Enable gzip compression, use CDNs for static content, optimize your database queries, implement proper indexing.

Architectural changes: Async processing for heavy operations, event-driven architecture, and sometimes, choosing the right database for the job.

We moved our analytics workload from PostgreSQL to ClickHouse and saw a 10x performance improvement.

## The Human Factor

**Alex:** Here's something that doesn't get talked about enough - the human factor in scaling APIs.

As your system grows, your team grows. You need proper documentation, code review processes, and deployment pipelines. You need to think about on-call rotations and incident response procedures.

The best technical architecture in the world won't save you if your team can't maintain it.

## Key Takeaways

**Alex:** Let me wrap up with five key takeaways:

1. Design for observability from day one
2. Separate concerns early, even in a monolith
3. Cache strategically, but prepare for cache invalidation complexity
4. Don't go microservices until you have to, but when you do, invest in tooling
5. Security and performance are not afterthoughts - they're architectural decisions

## Q&A Session

**Audience Member 1:** What's your take on GraphQL vs REST for scalable APIs?

**Alex:** Great question. We actually use both. REST for simple CRUD operations and public APIs, GraphQL for complex data fetching where clients need flexibility. GraphQL can be more efficient for mobile clients, but it adds complexity in caching and security. Choose based on your use case, not hype.

**Audience Member 2:** How do you handle API versioning at scale?

**Alex:** We use semantic versioning with backward compatibility as much as possible. When we need breaking changes, we run multiple versions in parallel with a deprecation timeline. Header-based versioning works better than URL-based for us. And always, always communicate changes well in advance to your API consumers.

**Audience Member 3:** What about testing strategies for large APIs?

**Alex:** Testing becomes critical at scale. We have unit tests, integration tests, contract tests between services, and end-to-end tests. But here's the key - we also do chaos engineering. Randomly killing services in production teaches you a lot about your system's resilience.

*[More questions continue...]*

## Closing

**Alex:** Building scalable APIs is a journey, not a destination. Every system is different, every team is different. What worked for us might not work for you, but I hope these lessons help you avoid some of the pitfalls we encountered.

Remember - premature optimization is the root of all evil, but so is ignoring scalability until it's too late. Find the balance that works for your context.

Thank you all for your attention, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions!
