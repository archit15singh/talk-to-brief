[00:03 -> 00:22] Welcome everyone. I'm going to talk about practical tactics to build reliable AI applications
  00:03-00:04:  Welcome
  00:15-00:16:  everyone.
  00:17-00:18:  I'm
  00:18-00:18:  going
  00:18-00:18:  to
  00:18-00:18:  talk
  00:18-00:18:  about
  00:18-00:19:  practical
  00:19-00:19:  tactics
  00:19-00:19:  to
  00:19-00:20:  build
  00:20-00:21:  reliable
  00:21-00:22:  AI
  00:22-00:22:  applications

[00:23 -> 00:30] and why nobody does it this way yet. A little bit about myself or why you should trust me.
  00:23-00:23:  and
  00:23-00:23:  why
  00:23-00:24:  nobody
  00:24-00:24:  does
  00:24-00:24:  it
  00:24-00:25:  this
  00:25-00:25:  way
  00:25-00:25:  yet.
  00:26-00:27:  A
  00:27-00:27:  little
  00:27-00:27:  bit
  00:27-00:28:  about
  00:28-00:28:  myself
  00:28-00:29:  or
  00:29-00:29:  why
  00:29-00:29:  you
  00:29-00:29:  should
  00:29-00:29:  trust
  00:29-00:30:  me.

[00:31 -> 00:42] I'm about 15 years as a startup co-founder and CTO. I held executive positions for the
  00:31-00:31:  I'm
  00:31-00:32:  about
  00:32-00:32:  15
  00:32-00:32:  years
  00:32-00:33:  as
  00:33-00:33:  a
  00:33-00:33:  startup
  00:33-00:34:  co
  00:34-00:34: -founder
  00:34-00:34:  and
  00:34-00:35:  CTO.
  00:36-00:36:  I
  00:36-00:36:  held
  00:36-00:37:  executive
  00:37-00:38:  positions
  00:38-00:42:  for
  00:42-00:42:  the

[00:42 -> 00:54] last couple of years developing a lot of projects ranging from POCs to many production-level solutions
  00:42-00:43:  last
  00:43-00:44:  couple
  00:44-00:44:  of
  00:44-00:44:  years
  00:44-00:45:  developing
  00:45-00:46:  a
  00:46-00:46:  lot
  00:46-00:47:  of
  00:47-00:48:  projects
  00:48-00:48:  ranging
  00:48-00:49:  from
  00:49-00:49:  POCs
  00:49-00:50:  to
  00:50-00:51:  many
  00:51-00:52:  production
  00:52-00:52: -level
  00:52-00:54:  solutions

[00:54 -> 01:04] and helped some companies to get it done. I've learned or distilled a way to make these
  00:54-00:55:  and
  00:55-00:55:  helped
  00:55-00:56:  some
  00:56-00:57:  companies
  00:57-00:57:  to
  00:57-00:57:  get
  00:57-00:57:  it
  00:57-00:58:  done.
  00:59-01:00:  I've
  01:00-01:00:  learned
  01:00-01:01:  or
  01:01-01:02:  distilled
  01:02-01:02:  a
  01:02-01:02:  way
  01:02-01:02:  to
  01:02-01:03:  make
  01:03-01:04:  these

[01:04 -> 01:15] applications reliable. There are quite a lot of tracks this conference about evals and reliability
  01:04-01:04:  applications
  01:04-01:05:  reliable.
  01:06-01:07:  There
  01:07-01:08:  are
  01:08-01:08:  quite
  01:08-01:08:  a
  01:08-01:08:  lot
  01:08-01:09:  of
  01:09-01:09:  tracks
  01:09-01:10:  this
  01:10-01:13:  conference
  01:13-01:13:  about
  01:13-01:14:  evals
  01:14-01:14:  and
  01:14-01:15:  reliability

[01:15 -> 01:23] but to my surprise nobody was talking about the most important things and we're going to talk
  01:15-01:16:  but
  01:16-01:16:  to
  01:16-01:16:  my
  01:16-01:17:  surprise
  01:17-01:17:  nobody
  01:17-01:19:  was
  01:19-01:19:  talking
  01:19-01:19:  about
  01:19-01:20:  the
  01:20-01:20:  most
  01:20-01:21:  important
  01:21-01:21:  things
  01:21-01:22:  and
  01:22-01:23:  we're
  01:23-01:23:  going
  01:23-01:23:  to
  01:23-01:23:  talk

[01:23 -> 01:34] about it right now. Standard software development lifecycle is very standard, simple. You design
  01:23-01:23:  about
  01:23-01:24:  it
  01:24-01:24:  right
  01:24-01:24:  now.
  01:26-01:27:  Standard
  01:27-01:27:  software
  01:27-01:28:  development
  01:28-01:28:  lifecycle
  01:28-01:29:  is
  01:29-01:30:  very
  01:30-01:31:  standard,
  01:32-01:33:  simple.
  01:33-01:33:  You
  01:33-01:34:  design

[01:34 -> 01:40] your solution, you develop it, you test it and then eventually you deploy it. When people start
  01:34-01:34:  your
  01:34-01:35:  solution,
  01:35-01:35:  you
  01:35-01:35:  develop
  01:35-01:35:  it,
  01:35-01:36:  you
  01:36-01:36:  test
  01:36-01:36:  it
  01:36-01:36:  and
  01:36-01:36:  then
  01:36-01:37:  eventually
  01:37-01:37:  you
  01:37-01:37:  deploy
  01:37-01:37:  it.
  01:38-01:39:  When
  01:39-01:40:  people
  01:40-01:40:  start

[01:40 -> 01:51] doing POC with AI, it sounds simple. You can very easily do some prompt and models are very
  01:40-01:41:  doing
  01:41-01:43:  POC
  01:43-01:43:  with
  01:43-01:44:  AI,
  01:45-01:45:  it
  01:45-01:46:  sounds
  01:46-01:46:  simple.
  01:47-01:47:  You
  01:47-01:47:  can
  01:47-01:48:  very
  01:48-01:48:  easily
  01:48-01:49:  do
  01:49-01:49:  some
  01:49-01:50:  prompt
  01:50-01:50:  and
  01:50-01:51:  models
  01:51-01:51:  are
  01:51-01:51:  very

[01:51 -> 02:01] capable but then you start facing some unexpected challenges. Actually, you can easily do a POC
  01:51-01:52:  capable
  01:52-01:53:  but
  01:53-01:53:  then
  01:53-01:54:  you
  01:54-01:54:  start
  01:54-01:55:  facing
  01:55-01:55:  some
  01:55-01:56:  unexpected
  01:56-01:57:  challenges.
  01:59-01:59:  Actually,
  02:00-02:00:  you
  02:00-02:00:  can
  02:00-02:01:  easily
  02:01-02:01:  do
  02:01-02:01:  a
  02:01-02:01:  POC

[02:01 -> 02:11] that works 50% of the time but making it do the same reliable work the rest of the 50% is very hard
  02:01-02:02:  that
  02:02-02:02:  works
  02:02-02:02:  50
  02:02-02:03: %
  02:03-02:03:  of
  02:03-02:03:  the
  02:03-02:03:  time
  02:03-02:04:  but
  02:04-02:05:  making
  02:05-02:05:  it
  02:05-02:06:  do
  02:06-02:06:  the
  02:06-02:06:  same
  02:06-02:07:  reliable
  02:07-02:07:  work
  02:07-02:08:  the
  02:08-02:08:  rest
  02:08-02:08:  of
  02:08-02:08:  the
  02:08-02:09:  50
  02:09-02:09: %
  02:09-02:09:  is
  02:09-02:10:  very
  02:10-02:11:  hard

[02:11 -> 02:20] because models are non-deterministic and it starts requiring a data science approach, continuous
  02:11-02:11:  because
  02:11-02:12:  models
  02:12-02:12:  are
  02:12-02:13:  non
  02:13-02:13: -deterministic
  02:13-02:14:  and
  02:14-02:15:  it
  02:15-02:16:  starts
  02:16-02:16:  requiring
  02:16-02:17:  a
  02:17-02:18:  data
  02:18-02:18:  science
  02:18-02:18:  approach,
  02:19-02:20:  continuous

[02:20 -> 02:24] experimentation. You need to try this prompt, you need to try that model, you need to try this
  02:20-02:20:  experimentation.
  02:21-02:21:  You
  02:21-02:21:  need
  02:21-02:21:  to
  02:21-02:21:  try
  02:21-02:21:  this
  02:21-02:22:  prompt,
  02:22-02:22:  you
  02:22-02:22:  need
  02:22-02:22:  to
  02:22-02:22:  try
  02:22-02:23:  that
  02:23-02:23:  model,
  02:23-02:23:  you
  02:23-02:23:  need
  02:23-02:23:  to
  02:23-02:23:  try
  02:23-02:24:  this

[02:24 -> 02:32] approach, etc. Everything in your solution, everything that represents your solution which is your
  02:24-02:24:  approach,
  02:24-02:25:  etc.
  02:26-02:27:  Everything
  02:27-02:29:  in
  02:29-02:29:  your
  02:29-02:29:  solution,
  02:29-02:30:  everything
  02:30-02:30:  that
  02:30-02:31:  represents
  02:31-02:31:  your
  02:31-02:32:  solution
  02:32-02:32:  which
  02:32-02:32:  is
  02:32-02:32:  your

[02:32 -> 02:38] code, your logic, the prompts that you use, the models that you use, the data that you base your
  02:32-02:33:  code,
  02:33-02:33:  your
  02:33-02:33:  logic,
  02:34-02:34:  the
  02:34-02:35:  prompts
  02:35-02:35:  that
  02:35-02:35:  you
  02:35-02:35:  use,
  02:36-02:36:  the
  02:36-02:36:  models
  02:36-02:36:  that
  02:36-02:36:  you
  02:36-02:37:  use,
  02:37-02:37:  the
  02:37-02:37:  data
  02:37-02:38:  that
  02:38-02:38:  you
  02:38-02:38:  base
  02:38-02:38:  your

[02:38 -> 02:51] solution on, changing anything of that impacts your solution in unexpected ways. People very
  02:38-02:39:  solution
  02:39-02:39:  on,
  02:40-02:40:  changing
  02:40-02:41:  anything
  02:41-02:42:  of
  02:42-02:42:  that
  02:42-02:42:  impacts
  02:42-02:43:  your
  02:43-02:44:  solution
  02:44-02:44:  in
  02:44-02:45:  unexpected
  02:45-02:45:  ways.
  02:50-02:50:  People
  02:50-02:51:  very

[02:51 -> 03:00] often come to this, to try solving this with the wrong approach. They start with data science
  02:51-02:52:  often
  02:52-02:52:  come
  02:52-02:52:  to
  02:52-02:53:  this,
  02:54-02:54:  to
  02:54-02:55:  try
  02:55-02:55:  solving
  02:55-02:56:  this
  02:56-02:56:  with
  02:56-02:57:  the
  02:57-02:57:  wrong
  02:57-02:57:  approach.
  02:58-02:58:  They
  02:58-02:59:  start
  02:59-02:59:  with
  02:59-03:00:  data
  03:00-03:00:  science

[03:00 -> 03:06] metrics. It sounds reasonable, right? So it requires data science approach of the experimentation
  03:00-03:01:  metrics.
  03:01-03:01:  It
  03:01-03:03:  sounds
  03:03-03:04:  reasonable,
  03:04-03:04:  right?
  03:04-03:04:  So
  03:04-03:04:  it
  03:04-03:05:  requires
  03:05-03:05:  data
  03:05-03:05:  science
  03:05-03:06:  approach
  03:06-03:06:  of
  03:06-03:06:  the
  03:06-03:06:  experimentation

[03:07 -> 03:16] and people start measuring groundness, factuality, bias and other metrics that don't really help
  03:07-03:07:  and
  03:07-03:08:  people
  03:08-03:08:  start
  03:08-03:09:  measuring
  03:09-03:10:  groundness,
  03:10-03:11:  factuality,
  03:11-03:11:  bias
  03:11-03:12:  and
  03:12-03:12:  other
  03:12-03:14:  metrics
  03:14-03:14:  that
  03:14-03:15:  don't
  03:15-03:15:  really
  03:15-03:16:  help

[03:16 -> 03:24] you to understand is your solution working the right way? Does it, does your latest change
  03:16-03:16:  you
  03:16-03:16:  to
  03:16-03:17:  understand
  03:17-03:18:  is
  03:18-03:19:  your
  03:19-03:19:  solution
  03:19-03:20:  working
  03:20-03:21:  the
  03:21-03:21:  right
  03:21-03:21:  way?
  03:22-03:22:  Does
  03:22-03:22:  it,
  03:22-03:23:  does
  03:23-03:23:  your
  03:23-03:24:  latest
  03:24-03:24:  change

[03:26 -> 03:31] improved your solution in the right way for your users? For example, I've been talking
  03:26-03:26:  improved
  03:26-03:27:  your
  03:27-03:27:  solution
  03:27-03:28:  in
  03:28-03:28:  the
  03:28-03:28:  right
  03:28-03:28:  way
  03:28-03:28:  for
  03:28-03:28:  your
  03:28-03:29:  users?
  03:30-03:30:  For
  03:30-03:31:  example,
  03:31-03:31:  I've
  03:31-03:31:  been
  03:31-03:31:  talking

[03:31 -> 03:37] to an ex-colleague that are building a customer support bot at Weeks. I asked him, how do
  03:31-03:32:  to
  03:32-03:32:  an
  03:32-03:33:  ex
  03:33-03:33: -colleague
  03:33-03:33:  that
  03:33-03:34:  are
  03:34-03:34:  building
  03:34-03:34:  a
  03:34-03:34:  customer
  03:34-03:35:  support
  03:35-03:35:  bot
  03:35-03:35:  at
  03:35-03:36:  Weeks.
  03:36-03:36:  I
  03:36-03:37:  asked
  03:37-03:37:  him,
  03:37-03:37:  how
  03:37-03:37:  do

[03:37 -> 03:42] you know that your solution is working well? He started talking about factuality and
  03:37-03:37:  you
  03:37-03:38:  know
  03:38-03:38:  that
  03:38-03:38:  your
  03:38-03:39:  solution
  03:39-03:39:  is
  03:39-03:39:  working
  03:39-03:39:  well?
  03:40-03:40:  He
  03:40-03:41:  started
  03:41-03:41:  talking
  03:41-03:41:  about
  03:41-03:42:  factuality
  03:42-03:42:  and

[03:42 -> 03:50] other data science metrics. That's again, I started to dig deeper and then we just together
  03:42-03:43:  other
  03:43-03:43:  data
  03:43-03:43:  science
  03:43-03:44:  metrics.
  03:46-03:47:  That's
  03:47-03:47:  again,
  03:47-03:47:  I
  03:47-03:48:  started
  03:48-03:48:  to
  03:48-03:48:  dig
  03:48-03:48:  deeper
  03:48-03:49:  and
  03:49-03:49:  then
  03:49-03:49:  we
  03:49-03:50:  just
  03:50-03:50:  together

[03:51 -> 03:59] figure out that the most important metric for them is the rate of moving from AI support
  03:51-03:51:  figure
  03:51-03:52:  out
  03:52-03:52:  that
  03:52-03:52:  the
  03:52-03:52:  most
  03:52-03:52:  important
  03:52-03:53:  metric
  03:53-03:53:  for
  03:53-03:53:  them
  03:53-03:54:  is
  03:54-03:56:  the
  03:56-03:56:  rate
  03:56-03:57:  of
  03:57-03:57:  moving
  03:57-03:58:  from
  03:58-03:59:  AI
  03:59-03:59:  support

[03:59 -> 04:07] bot like escalation to a human support. If your solution hasn't able to answer the
  03:59-04:00:  bot
  04:00-04:00:  like
  04:00-04:01:  escalation
  04:01-04:01:  to
  04:01-04:01:  a
  04:01-04:01:  human
  04:01-04:02:  support.
  04:03-04:03:  If
  04:03-04:04:  your
  04:04-04:04:  solution
  04:04-04:05:  hasn't
  04:05-04:06:  able
  04:06-04:06:  to
  04:06-04:06:  answer
  04:06-04:07:  the

[04:07 -> 04:12] user with all this factuality, like it could be super grounded but still not provide
  04:07-04:07:  user
  04:07-04:08:  with
  04:08-04:08:  all
  04:08-04:08:  this
  04:08-04:09:  factuality,
  04:09-04:10:  like
  04:10-04:10:  it
  04:10-04:10:  could
  04:10-04:10:  be
  04:10-04:10:  super
  04:10-04:11:  grounded
  04:11-04:11:  but
  04:11-04:11:  still
  04:11-04:11:  not
  04:11-04:12:  provide

[04:12 -> 04:22] the right answer that user expects and this is what you actually need to test. My experience
  04:12-04:12:  the
  04:12-04:12:  right
  04:12-04:13:  answer
  04:13-04:14:  that
  04:14-04:14:  user
  04:14-04:15:  expects
  04:15-04:15:  and
  04:15-04:16:  this
  04:16-04:16:  is
  04:16-04:16:  what
  04:16-04:16:  you
  04:16-04:17:  actually
  04:17-04:17:  need
  04:17-04:17:  to
  04:17-04:17:  test.
  04:21-04:21:  My
  04:21-04:22:  experience

[04:22 -> 04:30] was to start with real-world scenarios. Basically, you need to reverse engineer your metrics
  04:22-04:23:  was
  04:23-04:24:  to
  04:24-04:25:  start
  04:25-04:25:  with
  04:25-04:26:  real
  04:26-04:26: -world
  04:26-04:27:  scenarios.
  04:27-04:28:  Basically,
  04:28-04:28:  you
  04:28-04:28:  need
  04:28-04:28:  to
  04:28-04:29:  reverse
  04:29-04:29:  engineer
  04:29-04:30:  your
  04:30-04:30:  metrics

[04:30 -> 04:37] and your metrics should be very, very specific to what your end goal, so they should come
  04:30-04:31:  and
  04:31-04:31:  your
  04:31-04:31:  metrics
  04:31-04:32:  should
  04:32-04:32:  be
  04:32-04:33:  very,
  04:33-04:33:  very
  04:33-04:34:  specific
  04:34-04:34:  to
  04:34-04:35:  what
  04:35-04:35:  your
  04:35-04:36:  end
  04:36-04:36:  goal,
  04:36-04:36:  so
  04:36-04:37:  they
  04:37-04:37:  should
  04:37-04:37:  come

[04:37 -> 04:44] from a product experience, from business outcomes. If your solution is customer support bot, you
  04:37-04:38:  from
  04:38-04:38:  a
  04:38-04:38:  product
  04:38-04:39:  experience,
  04:40-04:40:  from
  04:40-04:40:  business
  04:40-04:41:  outcomes.
  04:42-04:42:  If
  04:42-04:43:  your
  04:43-04:43:  solution
  04:43-04:43:  is
  04:43-04:43:  customer
  04:43-04:43:  support
  04:43-04:44:  bot,
  04:44-04:44:  you

[04:44 -> 04:51] need to figure out what your users want and how you can mimic it. Instead of measuring
  04:44-04:44:  need
  04:44-04:44:  to
  04:44-04:44:  figure
  04:44-04:45:  out
  04:45-04:45:  what
  04:45-04:45:  your
  04:45-04:46:  users
  04:46-04:46:  want
  04:46-04:47:  and
  04:47-04:47:  how
  04:47-04:47:  you
  04:47-04:47:  can
  04:47-04:48:  mimic
  04:48-04:48:  it.
  04:49-04:50:  Instead
  04:50-04:50:  of
  04:50-04:51:  measuring

[04:51 -> 04:57] something average or something generic, you need to measure a very specific criteria
  04:51-04:51:  something
  04:51-04:52:  average
  04:52-04:53:  or
  04:53-04:53:  something
  04:53-04:54:  generic,
  04:54-04:54:  you
  04:54-04:55:  need
  04:55-04:55:  to
  04:55-04:55:  measure
  04:55-04:55:  a
  04:55-04:56:  very
  04:56-04:56:  specific
  04:56-04:57:  criteria

[04:58 -> 05:06] because universal valves don't really work. How do we do it? For example, customer
  04:58-04:59:  because
  04:59-04:59:  universal
  04:59-05:00:  valves
  05:00-05:00:  don't
  05:00-05:00:  really
  05:00-05:01:  work.
  05:03-05:03:  How
  05:03-05:03:  do
  05:03-05:03:  we
  05:03-05:03:  do
  05:03-05:04:  it?
  05:05-05:05:  For
  05:05-05:05:  example,
  05:06-05:06:  customer

[05:06 -> 05:13] support bot, which is by way one of the hardest things to do the valves properly. Let's say
  05:06-05:06:  support
  05:06-05:07:  bot,
  05:07-05:07:  which
  05:07-05:07:  is
  05:07-05:07:  by
  05:07-05:07:  way
  05:07-05:08:  one
  05:08-05:08:  of
  05:08-05:08:  the
  05:08-05:08:  hardest
  05:08-05:10:  things
  05:10-05:10:  to
  05:10-05:10:  do
  05:10-05:11:  the
  05:11-05:11:  valves
  05:11-05:11:  properly.
  05:12-05:13:  Let's
  05:13-05:13:  say

[05:13 -> 05:21] I have a bank and a bank has FAQ materials which contain, including how do you reset your
  05:13-05:13:  I
  05:13-05:13:  have
  05:13-05:14:  a
  05:14-05:14:  bank
  05:14-05:15:  and
  05:15-05:15:  a
  05:15-05:15:  bank
  05:15-05:16:  has
  05:16-05:17:  FAQ
  05:17-05:17:  materials
  05:17-05:19:  which
  05:19-05:19:  contain,
  05:20-05:20:  including
  05:20-05:20:  how
  05:20-05:20:  do
  05:20-05:21:  you
  05:21-05:21:  reset
  05:21-05:21:  your

[05:21 -> 05:31] password? What I usually do when I help my companies that I help them to build AI
  05:21-05:22:  password?
  05:24-05:24:  What
  05:24-05:25:  I
  05:25-05:26:  usually
  05:26-05:26:  do
  05:26-05:27:  when
  05:27-05:27:  I
  05:27-05:27:  help
  05:27-05:27:  my
  05:27-05:28:  companies
  05:28-05:29:  that
  05:29-05:29:  I
  05:29-05:29:  help
  05:29-05:30:  them
  05:30-05:30:  to
  05:30-05:30:  build
  05:30-05:31:  AI

[05:31 -> 05:37] solutions, we start with reverse engineering, like how do we create the valves based on that?
  05:31-05:32:  solutions,
  05:33-05:33:  we
  05:33-05:33:  start
  05:33-05:33:  with
  05:33-05:34:  reverse
  05:34-05:35:  engineering,
  05:35-05:35:  like
  05:35-05:35:  how
  05:35-05:36:  do
  05:36-05:36:  we
  05:36-05:36:  create
  05:36-05:36:  the
  05:36-05:36:  valves
  05:36-05:37:  based
  05:37-05:37:  on
  05:37-05:37:  that?

[05:38 -> 05:44] In this case, I use LLM, and in most cases I use LLM, to come up with right evaluations.
  05:38-05:38:  In
  05:38-05:38:  this
  05:38-05:38:  case,
  05:39-05:39:  I
  05:39-05:39:  use
  05:39-05:40:  LLM,
  05:40-05:40:  and
  05:40-05:41:  in
  05:41-05:41:  most
  05:41-05:41:  cases
  05:41-05:41:  I
  05:41-05:41:  use
  05:41-05:42:  LLM,
  05:42-05:42:  to
  05:42-05:42:  come
  05:42-05:42:  up
  05:42-05:43:  with
  05:43-05:43:  right
  05:43-05:44:  evaluations.

[05:45 -> 05:53] Here I can take, say, 01 or 03 now and just reverse engineer what should be the user
  05:45-05:45:  Here
  05:45-05:45:  I
  05:45-05:46:  can
  05:46-05:46:  take,
  05:46-05:47:  say,
  05:47-05:47:  01
  05:47-05:48:  or
  05:48-05:48:  03
  05:48-05:48:  now
  05:48-05:50:  and
  05:50-05:50:  just
  05:50-05:51:  reverse
  05:51-05:52:  engineer
  05:52-05:52:  what
  05:52-05:53:  should
  05:53-05:53:  be
  05:53-05:53:  the
  05:53-05:53:  user

[05:53 -> 05:59] question that we know to answer based on these materials and what should be the
  05:53-05:54:  question
  05:54-05:55:  that
  05:55-05:55:  we
  05:55-05:56:  know
  05:56-05:56:  to
  05:56-05:56:  answer
  05:56-05:57:  based
  05:57-05:57:  on
  05:57-05:57:  these
  05:57-05:58:  materials
  05:58-05:58:  and
  05:58-05:59:  what
  05:59-05:59:  should
  05:59-05:59:  be
  05:59-05:59:  the

[05:59 -> 06:07] specific criteria that these materials provide an answer for. Some of these criteria are quite
  05:59-05:59:  specific
  05:59-06:00:  criteria
  06:00-06:01:  that
  06:01-06:01:  these
  06:01-06:02:  materials
  06:02-06:03:  provide
  06:03-06:03:  an
  06:03-06:04:  answer
  06:04-06:04:  for.
  06:05-06:05:  Some
  06:05-06:05:  of
  06:05-06:05:  these
  06:05-06:06:  criteria
  06:06-06:06:  are
  06:06-06:07:  quite

[06:07 -> 06:13] important. For example, here it says that as part of the thing, you need to receive a
  06:07-06:07:  important.
  06:07-06:07:  For
  06:07-06:08:  example,
  06:08-06:08:  here
  06:08-06:08:  it
  06:08-06:08:  says
  06:08-06:09:  that
  06:09-06:10:  as
  06:10-06:10:  part
  06:10-06:11:  of
  06:11-06:11:  the
  06:11-06:11:  thing,
  06:12-06:12:  you
  06:12-06:12:  need
  06:12-06:12:  to
  06:12-06:13:  receive
  06:13-06:13:  a

[06:13 -> 06:19] mobile validation, so you receive a SMS code, and it says that if you don't have
  06:13-06:13:  mobile
  06:13-06:13:  validation,
  06:14-06:14:  so
  06:14-06:14:  you
  06:14-06:14:  receive
  06:14-06:14:  a
  06:14-06:15:  SMS
  06:15-06:15:  code,
  06:15-06:16:  and
  06:16-06:16:  it
  06:16-06:16:  says
  06:16-06:16:  that
  06:16-06:17:  if
  06:17-06:17:  you
  06:17-06:19:  don't
  06:19-06:19:  have

[06:19 -> 06:25] a mobile number then you can reach support, et cetera, et cetera. If some of that
  06:19-06:19:  a
  06:19-06:19:  mobile
  06:19-06:20:  number
  06:20-06:20:  then
  06:20-06:20:  you
  06:20-06:20:  can
  06:20-06:21:  reach
  06:21-06:22:  support,
  06:22-06:22:  et
  06:22-06:22:  cetera,
  06:22-06:23:  et
  06:23-06:23:  cetera.
  06:24-06:24:  If
  06:24-06:24:  some
  06:24-06:25:  of
  06:25-06:25:  that

[06:25 -> 06:31] information is missing from the answer, the answer would not be correct, but you need to
  06:25-06:25:  information
  06:25-06:26:  is
  06:26-06:26:  missing
  06:26-06:26:  from
  06:26-06:27:  the
  06:27-06:27:  answer,
  06:28-06:28:  the
  06:28-06:28:  answer
  06:28-06:29:  would
  06:29-06:29:  not
  06:29-06:29:  be
  06:29-06:30:  correct,
  06:30-06:30:  but
  06:30-06:31:  you
  06:31-06:31:  need
  06:31-06:31:  to

[06:31 -> 06:37] be very specific about what exact information you need to see in the answer, and that information
  06:31-06:31:  be
  06:31-06:31:  very
  06:31-06:32:  specific
  06:32-06:32:  about
  06:32-06:33:  what
  06:33-06:34:  exact
  06:34-06:34:  information
  06:34-06:35:  you
  06:35-06:35:  need
  06:35-06:35:  to
  06:35-06:35:  see
  06:35-06:35:  in
  06:35-06:36:  the
  06:36-06:36:  answer,
  06:36-06:36:  and
  06:36-06:36:  that
  06:36-06:37:  information

[06:37 -> 06:46] is very specific to that specific question. So you need to build lots of valves from the
  06:37-06:38:  is
  06:38-06:38:  very
  06:38-06:38:  specific
  06:38-06:38:  to
  06:38-06:39:  that
  06:39-06:39:  specific
  06:39-06:40:  question.
  06:40-06:40:  So
  06:40-06:41:  you
  06:41-06:41:  need
  06:41-06:41:  to
  06:41-06:41:  build
  06:41-06:42:  lots
  06:42-06:42:  of
  06:42-06:42:  valves
  06:42-06:45:  from
  06:45-06:46:  the

[06:46 -> 06:53] materials in this case that mimic specific user questions that you need to be able
  06:46-06:46:  materials
  06:46-06:46:  in
  06:46-06:47:  this
  06:47-06:47:  case
  06:47-06:48:  that
  06:48-06:48:  mimic
  06:48-06:49:  specific
  06:49-06:50:  user
  06:50-06:51:  questions
  06:51-06:52:  that
  06:52-06:52:  you
  06:52-06:53:  need
  06:53-06:53:  to
  06:53-06:53:  be
  06:53-06:53:  able

[06:53 -> 07:03] to answer for. How do we do it usually? Again, I work with smart models like 03, and I provide
  06:53-06:53:  to
  06:53-06:54:  answer
  06:54-06:54:  for.
  06:55-06:55:  How
  06:55-06:56:  do
  06:56-06:56:  we
  06:56-06:56:  do
  06:56-06:56:  it
  06:56-06:56:  usually?
  06:57-06:57:  Again,
  06:57-06:57:  I
  06:57-06:57:  work
  06:57-06:57:  with
  06:57-06:58:  smart
  06:58-06:59:  models
  06:59-06:59:  like
  06:59-06:59:  03,
  07:00-07:01:  and
  07:01-07:01:  I
  07:01-07:03:  provide

[07:03 -> 07:08] it enough context, I provide it which personas are we trying to represent, because you can
  07:03-07:03:  it
  07:03-07:03:  enough
  07:03-07:03:  context,
  07:04-07:04:  I
  07:04-07:04:  provide
  07:04-07:04:  it
  07:04-07:05:  which
  07:05-07:05:  personas
  07:05-07:06:  are
  07:06-07:06:  we
  07:06-07:06:  trying
  07:06-07:06:  to
  07:06-07:07:  represent,
  07:07-07:08:  because
  07:08-07:08:  you
  07:08-07:08:  can

[07:08 -> 07:14] make, ask the same question in completely different ways, depending on who is the
  07:08-07:08:  make,
  07:08-07:09:  ask
  07:09-07:09:  the
  07:09-07:09:  same
  07:09-07:10:  question
  07:10-07:10:  in
  07:10-07:11:  completely
  07:11-07:11:  different
  07:11-07:12:  ways,
  07:12-07:13:  depending
  07:13-07:13:  on
  07:13-07:14:  who
  07:14-07:14:  is
  07:14-07:14:  the

[07:14 -> 07:19] persona asking, yet you would expect exactly the same answer, so you need to account
  07:14-07:14:  persona
  07:14-07:15:  asking,
  07:15-07:16:  yet
  07:16-07:16:  you
  07:16-07:17:  would
  07:17-07:17:  expect
  07:17-07:18:  exactly
  07:18-07:18:  the
  07:18-07:18:  same
  07:18-07:18:  answer,
  07:18-07:18:  so
  07:18-07:19:  you
  07:19-07:19:  need
  07:19-07:19:  to
  07:19-07:19:  account

[07:19 -> 07:29] for it. So this is an example from the open source platform that we have that just helps
  07:19-07:19:  for
  07:19-07:19:  it.
  07:22-07:23:  So
  07:23-07:23:  this
  07:23-07:23:  is
  07:23-07:24:  an
  07:24-07:24:  example
  07:24-07:25:  from
  07:25-07:26:  the
  07:26-07:26:  open
  07:26-07:26:  source
  07:26-07:27:  platform
  07:27-07:27:  that
  07:27-07:27:  we
  07:27-07:27:  have
  07:27-07:28:  that
  07:28-07:29:  just
  07:29-07:29:  helps

[07:29 -> 07:35] to get it done. So if you look it up, I'm not trying to sell you anything, I'm not trying
  07:29-07:29:  to
  07:29-07:30:  get
  07:30-07:30:  it
  07:30-07:30:  done.
  07:31-07:31:  So
  07:31-07:32:  if
  07:32-07:32:  you
  07:32-07:32:  look
  07:32-07:32:  it
  07:32-07:32:  up,
  07:32-07:33:  I'm
  07:33-07:33:  not
  07:33-07:34:  trying
  07:34-07:34:  to
  07:34-07:34:  sell
  07:34-07:34:  you
  07:34-07:34:  anything,
  07:35-07:35:  I'm
  07:35-07:35:  not
  07:35-07:35:  trying

[07:35 -> 07:41] to like vendor lock in or whatever, it's completely open source, and if needed I can
  07:35-07:35:  to
  07:35-07:36:  like
  07:36-07:36:  vendor
  07:36-07:37:  lock
  07:37-07:37:  in
  07:37-07:37:  or
  07:37-07:37:  whatever,
  07:38-07:38:  it's
  07:38-07:38:  completely
  07:38-07:38:  open
  07:38-07:39:  source,
  07:39-07:40:  and
  07:40-07:40:  if
  07:40-07:41:  needed
  07:41-07:41:  I
  07:41-07:41:  can

[07:41 -> 07:45] just recreate it in a couple of days now with cursor, the point is in the approach,
  07:41-07:41:  just
  07:41-07:42:  recreate
  07:42-07:42:  it
  07:42-07:42:  in
  07:42-07:42:  a
  07:42-07:42:  couple
  07:42-07:42:  of
  07:42-07:43:  days
  07:43-07:43:  now
  07:43-07:43:  with
  07:43-07:44:  cursor,
  07:44-07:44:  the
  07:44-07:45:  point
  07:45-07:45:  is
  07:45-07:45:  in
  07:45-07:45:  the
  07:45-07:45:  approach,

[07:45 -> 07:53] not in the platform. So for example here we see that very same question, how do I reset
  07:45-07:46:  not
  07:46-07:46:  in
  07:46-07:46:  the
  07:46-07:46:  platform.
  07:47-07:48:  So
  07:48-07:48:  for
  07:48-07:48:  example
  07:48-07:48:  here
  07:48-07:49:  we
  07:49-07:49:  see
  07:49-07:50:  that
  07:50-07:50:  very
  07:50-07:51:  same
  07:51-07:51:  question,
  07:52-07:52:  how
  07:52-07:53:  do
  07:53-07:53:  I
  07:53-07:53:  reset

[07:53 -> 08:00] my password, you see what was the input, what was the output, and that specific criteria
  07:53-07:53:  my
  07:53-07:53:  password,
  07:54-07:54:  you
  07:54-07:55:  see
  07:55-07:56:  what
  07:56-07:56:  was
  07:56-07:56:  the
  07:56-07:56:  input,
  07:57-07:57:  what
  07:57-07:57:  was
  07:57-07:57:  the
  07:57-07:57:  output,
  07:58-07:58:  and
  07:58-07:59:  that
  07:59-08:00:  specific
  08:00-08:00:  criteria

[08:01 -> 08:09] that I measure it, that specific question, how do I know if the answer is correct? And
  08:01-08:01:  that
  08:01-08:01:  I
  08:01-08:02:  measure
  08:02-08:02:  it,
  08:04-08:04:  that
  08:04-08:05:  specific
  08:05-08:05:  question,
  08:06-08:06:  how
  08:06-08:06:  do
  08:06-08:06:  I
  08:06-08:06:  know
  08:06-08:07:  if
  08:07-08:07:  the
  08:07-08:07:  answer
  08:07-08:07:  is
  08:07-08:08:  correct?
  08:09-08:09:  And

[08:09 -> 08:14] now I can just reiterate and generate like 50 different variations of the same question
  08:09-08:09:  now
  08:09-08:09:  I
  08:09-08:10:  can
  08:10-08:10:  just
  08:10-08:10:  reiterate
  08:10-08:10:  and
  08:10-08:11:  generate
  08:11-08:11:  like
  08:11-08:12:  50
  08:12-08:13:  different
  08:13-08:13:  variations
  08:13-08:13:  of
  08:13-08:14:  the
  08:14-08:14:  same
  08:14-08:14:  question

[08:14 -> 08:21] and see if I still get the right answer, if the answer matches all the check list that
  08:14-08:15:  and
  08:15-08:15:  see
  08:15-08:15:  if
  08:15-08:15:  I
  08:15-08:16:  still
  08:16-08:17:  get
  08:17-08:17:  the
  08:17-08:17:  right
  08:17-08:18:  answer,
  08:18-08:18:  if
  08:18-08:18:  the
  08:18-08:18:  answer
  08:18-08:19:  matches
  08:19-08:19:  all
  08:19-08:20:  the
  08:20-08:20:  check
  08:20-08:20:  list
  08:20-08:21:  that

[08:21 -> 08:30] I have for that specific answer. How the process usually works? So contrary to like
  08:21-08:21:  I
  08:21-08:21:  have
  08:21-08:21:  for
  08:21-08:22:  that
  08:22-08:22:  specific
  08:22-08:22:  answer.
  08:25-08:26:  How
  08:26-08:26:  the
  08:26-08:26:  process
  08:26-08:26:  usually
  08:26-08:27:  works?
  08:29-08:29:  So
  08:29-08:30:  contrary
  08:30-08:30:  to
  08:30-08:30:  like

[08:30 -> 08:35] regular approach, you build your evals not at the end of the process, but at the very
  08:30-08:31:  regular
  08:31-08:31:  approach,
  08:32-08:32:  you
  08:32-08:32:  build
  08:32-08:32:  your
  08:32-08:32:  evals
  08:32-08:33:  not
  08:33-08:33:  at
  08:33-08:33:  the
  08:33-08:34:  end
  08:34-08:34:  of
  08:34-08:34:  the
  08:34-08:34:  process,
  08:34-08:35:  but
  08:35-08:35:  at
  08:35-08:35:  the
  08:35-08:35:  very

[08:35 -> 08:43] beginning of the process. So just build your first version of the POC, you define the
  08:35-08:36:  beginning
  08:36-08:36:  of
  08:36-08:36:  the
  08:36-08:36:  process.
  08:37-08:37:  So
  08:37-08:38:  just
  08:38-08:38:  build
  08:38-08:39:  your
  08:39-08:39:  first
  08:39-08:39:  version
  08:39-08:40:  of
  08:40-08:40:  the
  08:40-08:41:  POC,
  08:42-08:42:  you
  08:42-08:43:  define
  08:43-08:43:  the

[08:43 -> 08:49] first version of your test evaluations, you run them and you see what's going on, you will
  08:43-08:44:  first
  08:44-08:44:  version
  08:44-08:44:  of
  08:44-08:44:  your
  08:44-08:45:  test
  08:45-08:45:  evaluations,
  08:46-08:47:  you
  08:47-08:47:  run
  08:47-08:47:  them
  08:47-08:48:  and
  08:48-08:48:  you
  08:48-08:48:  see
  08:48-08:48:  what's
  08:48-08:48:  going
  08:48-08:49:  on,
  08:49-08:49:  you
  08:49-08:49:  will

[08:49 -> 08:56] see that in some cases it will fail, in some cases it will succeed. What's important is
  08:49-08:50:  see
  08:50-08:50:  that
  08:50-08:51:  in
  08:51-08:51:  some
  08:51-08:51:  cases
  08:51-08:51:  it
  08:51-08:51:  will
  08:51-08:52:  fail,
  08:53-08:53:  in
  08:53-08:53:  some
  08:53-08:53:  cases
  08:53-08:53:  it
  08:53-08:53:  will
  08:53-08:54:  succeed.
  08:55-08:55:  What's
  08:55-08:55:  important
  08:55-08:56:  is

[08:56 -> 09:01] to look at the details, not just see the average numbers, the average numbers won't
  08:56-08:56:  to
  08:56-08:57:  look
  08:57-08:57:  at
  08:57-08:57:  the
  08:57-08:58:  details,
  08:58-08:58:  not
  08:58-08:58:  just
  08:58-08:59:  see
  08:59-08:59:  the
  08:59-08:59:  average
  08:59-08:59:  numbers,
  09:00-09:00:  the
  09:00-09:00:  average
  09:00-09:00:  numbers
  09:00-09:01:  won't

[09:01 -> 09:07] tell you anything, won't tell you how to improve it. If you actually look at the details
  09:01-09:01:  tell
  09:01-09:01:  you
  09:01-09:01:  anything,
  09:02-09:03:  won't
  09:03-09:04:  tell
  09:04-09:04:  you
  09:04-09:04:  how
  09:04-09:04:  to
  09:04-09:05:  improve
  09:05-09:05:  it.
  09:05-09:05:  If
  09:05-09:06:  you
  09:06-09:06:  actually
  09:06-09:06:  look
  09:06-09:06:  at
  09:06-09:06:  the
  09:06-09:07:  details

[09:07 -> 09:11] of each evaluation, you'll see exactly why it's failing, it could be failing
  09:07-09:07:  of
  09:07-09:07:  each
  09:07-09:08:  evaluation,
  09:08-09:09:  you'll
  09:09-09:09:  see
  09:09-09:09:  exactly
  09:09-09:10:  why
  09:10-09:10:  it's
  09:10-09:10:  failing,
  09:10-09:11:  it
  09:11-09:11:  could
  09:11-09:11:  be
  09:11-09:11:  failing

[09:12 -> 09:18] because your test is not defined correctly, it could be failing because your solution is
  09:12-09:13:  because
  09:13-09:13:  your
  09:13-09:13:  test
  09:13-09:14:  is
  09:14-09:14:  not
  09:14-09:14:  defined
  09:14-09:15:  correctly,
  09:15-09:15:  it
  09:15-09:16:  could
  09:16-09:16:  be
  09:16-09:16:  failing
  09:16-09:16:  because
  09:16-09:17:  your
  09:17-09:17:  solution
  09:17-09:18:  is

[09:18 -> 09:25] not working as it should be, and like in order to do it, you may need to do a change in,
  09:18-09:18:  not
  09:18-09:18:  working
  09:18-09:19:  as
  09:19-09:19:  it
  09:19-09:19:  should
  09:19-09:19:  be,
  09:20-09:20:  and
  09:20-09:21:  like
  09:21-09:21:  in
  09:21-09:21:  order
  09:21-09:22:  to
  09:22-09:22:  do
  09:22-09:22:  it,
  09:22-09:22:  you
  09:22-09:23:  may
  09:23-09:23:  need
  09:23-09:23:  to
  09:23-09:24:  do
  09:24-09:24:  a
  09:24-09:25:  change
  09:25-09:25:  in,

[09:25 -> 09:29] like you may change a model, you may change something in your logic, you may change
  09:25-09:26:  like
  09:26-09:26:  you
  09:26-09:26:  may
  09:26-09:26:  change
  09:26-09:26:  a
  09:26-09:26:  model,
  09:27-09:27:  you
  09:27-09:27:  may
  09:27-09:27:  change
  09:27-09:28:  something
  09:28-09:28:  in
  09:28-09:28:  your
  09:28-09:29:  logic,
  09:29-09:29:  you
  09:29-09:29:  may
  09:29-09:29:  change

[09:29 -> 09:37] a prompt or the data that you use in order to answer a question in our example. And
  09:29-09:29:  a
  09:29-09:30:  prompt
  09:30-09:31:  or
  09:31-09:31:  the
  09:31-09:31:  data
  09:31-09:32:  that
  09:32-09:32:  you
  09:32-09:32:  use
  09:32-09:32:  in
  09:32-09:32:  order
  09:32-09:33:  to
  09:33-09:34:  answer
  09:34-09:34:  a
  09:34-09:35:  question
  09:35-09:35:  in
  09:35-09:35:  our
  09:35-09:35:  example.
  09:37-09:37:  And

[09:38 -> 09:43] basically what you do now is experimentation, so you start running your experiment, you
  09:38-09:38:  basically
  09:38-09:39:  what
  09:39-09:39:  you
  09:39-09:39:  do
  09:39-09:39:  now
  09:39-09:39:  is
  09:39-09:40:  experimentation,
  09:40-09:40:  so
  09:40-09:41:  you
  09:41-09:41:  start
  09:41-09:42:  running
  09:42-09:42:  your
  09:42-09:42:  experiment,
  09:43-09:43:  you

[09:43 -> 09:50] change something, you need to define these tests in a way that will help you to make an
  09:43-09:43:  change
  09:43-09:43:  something,
  09:44-09:44:  you
  09:44-09:45:  need
  09:45-09:45:  to
  09:45-09:45:  define
  09:45-09:46:  these
  09:46-09:46:  tests
  09:46-09:47:  in
  09:47-09:47:  a
  09:47-09:47:  way
  09:47-09:47:  that
  09:47-09:48:  will
  09:48-09:49:  help
  09:49-09:49:  you
  09:49-09:49:  to
  09:49-09:49:  make
  09:49-09:50:  an

[09:50 -> 09:56] educated guess on what you need to change in order to do it, in some cases it will
  09:50-09:50:  educated
  09:50-09:51:  guess
  09:51-09:51:  on
  09:51-09:52:  what
  09:52-09:53:  you
  09:53-09:53:  need
  09:53-09:53:  to
  09:53-09:53:  change
  09:53-09:54:  in
  09:54-09:54:  order
  09:54-09:54:  to
  09:54-09:54:  do
  09:54-09:54:  it,
  09:55-09:55:  in
  09:55-09:56:  some
  09:56-09:56:  cases
  09:56-09:56:  it
  09:56-09:56:  will

[09:56 -> 10:02] work, in some cases it won't, but even if it works, let's say you change something
  09:56-09:56:  work,
  09:56-09:57:  in
  09:57-09:57:  some
  09:57-09:57:  cases
  09:57-09:57:  it
  09:57-09:57:  won't,
  09:58-09:58:  but
  09:58-09:58:  even
  09:58-09:58:  if
  09:58-09:58:  it
  09:58-09:59:  works,
  10:00-10:01:  let's
  10:01-10:01:  say
  10:01-10:01:  you
  10:01-10:01:  change
  10:01-10:02:  something

[10:02 -> 10:08] in your prompt and it fixed this test. In my experience in many cases it breaks something
  10:02-10:02:  in
  10:02-10:02:  your
  10:02-10:02:  prompt
  10:02-10:03:  and
  10:03-10:03:  it
  10:03-10:03:  fixed
  10:03-10:04:  this
  10:04-10:04:  test.
  10:05-10:05:  In
  10:05-10:05:  my
  10:05-10:06:  experience
  10:06-10:06:  in
  10:06-10:06:  many
  10:06-10:06:  cases
  10:06-10:07:  it
  10:07-10:07:  breaks
  10:07-10:08:  something

[10:08 -> 10:15] that used to work before, like you have constant regressions and if you don't have
  10:08-10:08:  that
  10:08-10:08:  used
  10:08-10:09:  to
  10:09-10:09:  work
  10:09-10:09:  before,
  10:10-10:10:  like
  10:10-10:11:  you
  10:11-10:12:  have
  10:12-10:12:  constant
  10:12-10:12:  regressions
  10:12-10:14:  and
  10:14-10:14:  if
  10:14-10:14:  you
  10:14-10:14:  don't
  10:14-10:15:  have

[10:15 -> 10:20] these evaluations there's no way you'll be able to catch it on time. So this is hugely
  10:15-10:15:  these
  10:15-10:15:  evaluations
  10:15-10:16:  there's
  10:16-10:16:  no
  10:16-10:16:  way
  10:16-10:16:  you'll
  10:16-10:17:  be
  10:17-10:17:  able
  10:17-10:17:  to
  10:17-10:17:  catch
  10:17-10:17:  it
  10:17-10:17:  on
  10:17-10:18:  time.
  10:19-10:19:  So
  10:19-10:20:  this
  10:20-10:20:  is
  10:20-10:20:  hugely

[10:20 -> 10:25] important and what actually happens is that, again, you build your first version, you
  10:20-10:21:  important
  10:21-10:21:  and
  10:21-10:21:  what
  10:21-10:22:  actually
  10:22-10:23:  happens
  10:23-10:23:  is
  10:23-10:23:  that,
  10:23-10:23:  again,
  10:23-10:24:  you
  10:24-10:24:  build
  10:24-10:24:  your
  10:24-10:24:  first
  10:24-10:25:  version,
  10:25-10:25:  you

[10:25 -> 10:30] build your first version of the VALS, you match them, you run these VALS, you improve
  10:25-10:25:  build
  10:25-10:26:  your
  10:26-10:26:  first
  10:26-10:26:  version
  10:26-10:26:  of
  10:26-10:26:  the
  10:26-10:27:  VALS,
  10:27-10:28:  you
  10:28-10:28:  match
  10:28-10:28:  them,
  10:28-10:28:  you
  10:28-10:29:  run
  10:29-10:29:  these
  10:29-10:29:  VALS,
  10:29-10:30:  you
  10:30-10:30:  improve

[10:30 -> 10:35] something, you improve your VALS, or maybe add more evaluations and then you continuously
  10:30-10:30:  something,
  10:30-10:30:  you
  10:30-10:31:  improve
  10:31-10:31:  your
  10:31-10:31:  VALS,
  10:31-10:32:  or
  10:32-10:32:  maybe
  10:32-10:32:  add
  10:32-10:32:  more
  10:32-10:33:  evaluations
  10:33-10:34:  and
  10:34-10:34:  then
  10:34-10:34:  you
  10:34-10:35:  continuously

[10:35 -> 10:42] improve it until you reach some point where you are satisfied with your VALS for this
  10:35-10:36:  improve
  10:36-10:36:  it
  10:36-10:37:  until
  10:37-10:37:  you
  10:37-10:38:  reach
  10:38-10:38:  some
  10:38-10:39:  point
  10:39-10:39:  where
  10:39-10:39:  you
  10:39-10:40:  are
  10:40-10:40:  satisfied
  10:40-10:41:  with
  10:41-10:41:  your
  10:41-10:41:  VALS
  10:41-10:42:  for
  10:42-10:42:  this

[10:42 -> 10:48] specific solution, for that specific point of time. And what actually happened is that
  10:42-10:43:  specific
  10:43-10:43:  solution,
  10:43-10:43:  for
  10:43-10:44:  that
  10:44-10:44:  specific
  10:44-10:44:  point
  10:44-10:44:  of
  10:44-10:45:  time.
  10:46-10:46:  And
  10:46-10:47:  what
  10:47-10:47:  actually
  10:47-10:48:  happened
  10:48-10:48:  is
  10:48-10:48:  that

[10:48 -> 10:56] you got your baseline, you got your benchmark that now you can start optimizing and you
  10:48-10:48:  you
  10:48-10:49:  got
  10:49-10:49:  your
  10:49-10:50:  baseline,
  10:50-10:50:  you
  10:50-10:50:  got
  10:50-10:50:  your
  10:50-10:51:  benchmark
  10:51-10:51:  that
  10:51-10:52:  now
  10:52-10:52:  you
  10:52-10:53:  can
  10:53-10:53:  start
  10:53-10:54:  optimizing
  10:54-10:55:  and
  10:55-10:56:  you

[10:56 -> 11:02] have the confidence that the tests should be working, so now you can try another model.
  10:56-10:56:  have
  10:56-10:56:  the
  10:56-10:57:  confidence
  10:57-10:58:  that
  10:58-10:58:  the
  10:58-10:58:  tests
  10:58-10:59:  should
  10:59-10:59:  be
  10:59-11:00:  working,
  11:00-11:00:  so
  11:00-11:00:  now
  11:00-11:01:  you
  11:01-11:01:  can
  11:01-11:01:  try
  11:01-11:01:  another
  11:01-11:02:  model.
