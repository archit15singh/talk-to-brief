[00:14 -> 00:21] Welcome everyone. I'm going to talk about practical tactics to build reliable AI
  00:14-00:15:  Welcome
  00:15-00:15:  everyone.
  00:17-00:17:  I'm
  00:17-00:18:  going
  00:18-00:18:  to
  00:18-00:18:  talk
  00:18-00:18:  about
  00:18-00:19:  practical
  00:19-00:19:  tactics
  00:19-00:19:  to
  00:19-00:20:  build
  00:20-00:20:  reliable
  00:20-00:21:  AI

[00:21 -> 00:29] applications and why nobody does it this way yet. A little bit about myself or why
  00:21-00:22:  applications
  00:22-00:23:  and
  00:23-00:23:  why
  00:23-00:24:  nobody
  00:24-00:24:  does
  00:24-00:24:  it
  00:24-00:24:  this
  00:24-00:25:  way
  00:25-00:25:  yet.
  00:26-00:27:  A
  00:27-00:27:  little
  00:27-00:27:  bit
  00:27-00:28:  about
  00:28-00:28:  myself
  00:28-00:28:  or
  00:28-00:29:  why

[00:29 -> 00:37] you should trust me. I've allowed 15 years as a startup co-founder and CTO. I held executive
  00:29-00:29:  you
  00:29-00:29:  should
  00:29-00:29:  trust
  00:29-00:30:  me.
  00:31-00:31:  I've
  00:31-00:31:  allowed
  00:31-00:32:  15
  00:32-00:32:  years
  00:32-00:33:  as
  00:33-00:33:  a
  00:33-00:33:  startup
  00:33-00:33:  co
  00:33-00:34: -founder
  00:34-00:34:  and
  00:34-00:35:  CTO.
  00:35-00:36:  I
  00:36-00:36:  held
  00:36-00:37:  executive

[00:37 -> 00:43] positions for the last five years at several enterprises. But most importantly, I spent
  00:37-00:37:  positions
  00:37-00:38:  for
  00:38-00:38:  the
  00:38-00:38:  last
  00:38-00:38:  five
  00:38-00:39:  years
  00:39-00:39:  at
  00:39-00:40:  several
  00:40-00:41:  enterprises.
  00:41-00:42:  But
  00:42-00:42:  most
  00:42-00:42:  importantly,
  00:42-00:43:  I
  00:43-00:43:  spent

[00:43 -> 00:52] last couple of years developing a lot of Gen-A projects ranging from POCs to many production
  00:43-00:43:  last
  00:43-00:44:  couple
  00:44-00:44:  of
  00:44-00:44:  years
  00:44-00:45:  developing
  00:45-00:46:  a
  00:46-00:46:  lot
  00:46-00:47:  of
  00:47-00:47:  Gen
  00:47-00:47: -A
  00:47-00:47:  projects
  00:47-00:48:  ranging
  00:48-00:48:  from
  00:48-00:49:  POCs
  00:49-00:49:  to
  00:49-00:51:  many
  00:51-00:52:  production

[00:52 -> 00:58] level solutions and helped some companies to get it done.
  00:52-00:52:  level
  00:52-00:54:  solutions
  00:54-00:55:  and
  00:55-00:55:  helped
  00:55-00:56:  some
  00:56-00:57:  companies
  00:57-00:57:  to
  00:57-00:57:  get
  00:57-00:57:  it
  00:57-00:58:  done.

[00:58 -> 01:08] And I've learned or distilled a way to make these applications reliable. And there are quite a lot
  00:58-00:59:  And
  00:59-01:00:  I've
  01:00-01:00:  learned
  01:00-01:01:  or
  01:01-01:01:  distilled
  01:01-01:02:  a
  01:02-01:02:  way
  01:02-01:02:  to
  01:02-01:03:  make
  01:03-01:04:  these
  01:04-01:04:  applications
  01:04-01:04:  reliable.
  01:06-01:06:  And
  01:06-01:07:  there
  01:07-01:08:  are
  01:08-01:08:  quite
  01:08-01:08:  a
  01:08-01:08:  lot

[01:08 -> 01:19] of tracks this conference about evals and reliability. But to my surprise, nobody was
  01:08-01:09:  of
  01:09-01:09:  tracks
  01:09-01:10:  this
  01:10-01:12:  conference
  01:12-01:13:  about
  01:13-01:14:  evals
  01:14-01:14:  and
  01:14-01:15:  reliability.
  01:15-01:15:  But
  01:15-01:16:  to
  01:16-01:16:  my
  01:16-01:17:  surprise,
  01:17-01:17:  nobody
  01:17-01:19:  was

[01:19 -> 01:27] talking about the most important things. And we're going to talk about it right now. So standards of
  01:19-01:19:  talking
  01:19-01:19:  about
  01:19-01:19:  the
  01:19-01:20:  most
  01:20-01:21:  important
  01:21-01:21:  things.
  01:21-01:22:  And
  01:22-01:23:  we're
  01:23-01:23:  going
  01:23-01:23:  to
  01:23-01:23:  talk
  01:23-01:23:  about
  01:23-01:23:  it
  01:23-01:24:  right
  01:24-01:24:  now.
  01:25-01:26:  So
  01:26-01:27:  standards
  01:27-01:27:  of

[01:28 -> 01:36] development lifecycle is very standard, simple. You design your solution, you develop it, you test
  01:28-01:28:  development
  01:28-01:28:  lifecycle
  01:28-01:29:  is
  01:29-01:30:  very
  01:30-01:31:  standard,
  01:31-01:32:  simple.
  01:33-01:33:  You
  01:33-01:34:  design
  01:34-01:34:  your
  01:34-01:34:  solution,
  01:35-01:35:  you
  01:35-01:35:  develop
  01:35-01:35:  it,
  01:35-01:35:  you
  01:35-01:36:  test

[01:36 -> 01:46] it, and then eventually you deploy it. And when people start doing POC with AI, it sounds simple,
  01:36-01:36:  it,
  01:36-01:36:  and
  01:36-01:36:  then
  01:36-01:37:  eventually
  01:37-01:37:  you
  01:37-01:37:  deploy
  01:37-01:37:  it.
  01:38-01:38:  And
  01:38-01:40:  when
  01:40-01:40:  people
  01:40-01:40:  start
  01:40-01:41:  doing
  01:41-01:43:  POC
  01:43-01:43:  with
  01:43-01:43:  AI,
  01:44-01:45:  it
  01:45-01:46:  sounds
  01:46-01:46:  simple,

[01:46 -> 01:55] like you can very easily do some prompt and models are very capable. But then you start facing some
  01:46-01:47:  like
  01:47-01:47:  you
  01:47-01:47:  can
  01:47-01:47:  very
  01:47-01:48:  easily
  01:48-01:49:  do
  01:49-01:49:  some
  01:49-01:49:  prompt
  01:49-01:50:  and
  01:50-01:51:  models
  01:51-01:51:  are
  01:51-01:51:  very
  01:51-01:52:  capable.
  01:52-01:53:  But
  01:53-01:53:  then
  01:53-01:53:  you
  01:53-01:54:  start
  01:54-01:55:  facing
  01:55-01:55:  some

[01:55 -> 01:57] unexpected challenges.
  01:55-01:56:  unexpected
  01:56-01:57:  challenges.

[01:59 -> 02:06] Actually, like you can easily do a POC that works 50% of the time. But like making it do the same
  01:59-01:59:  Actually,
  01:59-02:00:  like
  02:00-02:00:  you
  02:00-02:00:  can
  02:00-02:01:  easily
  02:01-02:01:  do
  02:01-02:01:  a
  02:01-02:01:  POC
  02:01-02:01:  that
  02:01-02:02:  works
  02:02-02:02:  50
  02:02-02:03: %
  02:03-02:03:  of
  02:03-02:03:  the
  02:03-02:03:  time.
  02:03-02:04:  But
  02:04-02:04:  like
  02:04-02:05:  making
  02:05-02:05:  it
  02:05-02:06:  do
  02:06-02:06:  the
  02:06-02:06:  same

[02:06 -> 02:15] reliable work, the rest of the 50% is very hard, because models are non deterministic. And it
  02:06-02:07:  reliable
  02:07-02:07:  work,
  02:07-02:08:  the
  02:08-02:08:  rest
  02:08-02:08:  of
  02:08-02:08:  the
  02:08-02:09:  50
  02:09-02:09: %
  02:09-02:09:  is
  02:09-02:10:  very
  02:10-02:10:  hard,
  02:11-02:11:  because
  02:11-02:12:  models
  02:12-02:12:  are
  02:12-02:13:  non
  02:13-02:13:  deterministic.
  02:14-02:14:  And
  02:14-02:15:  it

[02:15 -> 02:22] starts requiring a data science approach, continuous experimentation, you need to try this prompt, you
  02:15-02:16:  starts
  02:16-02:16:  requiring
  02:16-02:17:  a
  02:17-02:18:  data
  02:18-02:18:  science
  02:18-02:18:  approach,
  02:19-02:19:  continuous
  02:19-02:20:  experimentation,
  02:20-02:21:  you
  02:21-02:21:  need
  02:21-02:21:  to
  02:21-02:21:  try
  02:21-02:21:  this
  02:21-02:22:  prompt,
  02:22-02:22:  you

[02:22 -> 02:25] need to try that model, you need to try this approach, etc, etc.
  02:22-02:22:  need
  02:22-02:22:  to
  02:22-02:22:  try
  02:22-02:22:  that
  02:22-02:23:  model,
  02:23-02:23:  you
  02:23-02:23:  need
  02:23-02:23:  to
  02:23-02:23:  try
  02:23-02:24:  this
  02:24-02:24:  approach,
  02:24-02:25:  etc,
  02:25-02:25:  etc.

[02:28 -> 02:34] Everything in your solution, everything that represents your solution, which is your code, your logic, the
  02:28-02:28:  Everything
  02:28-02:29:  in
  02:29-02:29:  your
  02:29-02:29:  solution,
  02:29-02:29:  everything
  02:29-02:30:  that
  02:30-02:31:  represents
  02:31-02:31:  your
  02:31-02:32:  solution,
  02:32-02:32:  which
  02:32-02:32:  is
  02:32-02:32:  your
  02:32-02:33:  code,
  02:33-02:33:  your
  02:33-02:33:  logic,
  02:34-02:34:  the

[02:34 -> 02:41] prompt that you use, the models that you use, the data that you base your solution on, changing anything of
  02:34-02:35:  prompt
  02:35-02:35:  that
  02:35-02:35:  you
  02:35-02:35:  use,
